## My process

firstly i had created the desktop design and take help from the internet and finally i had create the mobile design by using media query.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Help from youtube and internet.


### What I learned

I had learned how to arrange a svg images in a document accordingly and box shadow property and i have to work hard for moving one step further.



### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on fixed width of an div while using flexbox in future projects. i have learn some further in responsive websites and i have to work more on that. I have to learn other techniques which found useful for me to refine and perfect and i learn how to arrange svg images using transform property.
